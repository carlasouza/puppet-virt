## Path: System/xen
## Description: xen domain start/stop on boot
## Type: string
## Default: 
#
# The xendomains script can send SysRq requests to domains on shutdown.
# If you don't want to MIGRATE, SAVE, or SHUTDOWN, this may be a possibility
# to do a quick and dirty shutdown ("s e i u o") or at least sync the disks
# of the domains ("s").
#
XENDOMAINS_SYSRQ=""

## Type: integer 
## Default: 100000
#
# If XENDOMAINS_SYSRQ is set, this variable determines how long to wait
# (in microseconds) after each SysRq, so the domain has a chance to react.
# If you want to a quick'n'dirty shutdown via SysRq, you may want to set
# it to a relatively high value (1200000).
#
XENDOMAINS_USLEEP=100000

## Type: integer
## Default: 5000000
#
# When creating a guest domain, it is sensible to allow a little time for it
# to get started before creating another domain or proceeding through the
# boot process.  Without this, the booting guests will thrash the disk as they
# start up.  This timeout (in microseconds) specifies the delay after guest
# domain creation.
#
XENDOMAINS_CREATE_USLEEP=5000000

## Type: string
## Default: ""
#
# Set this to a non-empty string if you want to migrate virtual machines
# on shutdown. The string will be passed to the xm migrate DOMID command
# as is: It should contain the target IP address of the physical machine
# to migrate to and optionally parameters like --live. Leave empty if
# you don't want to try virtual machine relocation on shutdown.
# If migration succeeds, neither SAVE nor SHUTDOWN will be executed for
# that domain.
#
XENDOMAINS_MIGRATE=""

## Type: string
## Default: /var/lib/xen/save
#
# Directory to save running domains to when the system (dom0) is
# shut down. Will also be used to restore domains from if # XENDOMAINS_RESTORE
# is set (see below). Leave empty to disable domain saving on shutdown 
# (e.g. because you rather shut domains down).
# If domain saving does succeed, SHUTDOWN will not be executed.
#
XENDOMAINS_SAVE=

## Type: string
## Default: "--halt --wait"
#
# If neither MIGRATE nor SAVE were enabled or if they failed, you can
# try to shut down a domain by sending it a shutdown request. To do this,
# set this to "--halt --wait". Omit the "--wait" flag to avoid waiting
# for the domain to be really down. Leave empty to skip domain shutdown.
#
XENDOMAINS_SHUTDOWN="--halt --wait"

## Type: string
## Default: "--all --halt --wait"
#
# After we have gone over all virtual machines (resp. all automatically
# started ones, see XENDOMAINS_AUTO_ONLY below) in a loop and sent SysRq,
# migrated, saved and/or shutdown according to the settings above, we
# might want to shutdown the virtual machines that are still running
# for some reason or another. To do this, set this variable to
# "--all --halt --wait", it will be passed to xm shutdown.
# Leave it empty not to do anything special here.
# (Note: This will hit all virtual machines, even if XENDOMAINS_AUTO_ONLY
# is set.)
# 
XENDOMAINS_SHUTDOWN_ALL="--all --halt --wait"

## Type: boolean
## Default: true
#
# This variable determines whether saved domains from XENDOMAINS_SAVE
# will be restored on system startup. 
#
XENDOMAINS_RESTORE=false

## Type: string
## Default: /etc/xen/auto
#
# This variable sets the directory where domains configurations
# are stored that should be started on system startup automatically.
# Leave empty if you don't want to start domains automatically
# (or just don't place any xen domain config files in that dir).
# Note that the script tries to be clever if both RESTORE and AUTO are 
# set: It will first restore saved domains and then only start domains
# in AUTO which are not running yet. 
# Note that the name matching is somewhat fuzzy.
#
XENDOMAINS_AUTO=/etc/xen/auto

## Type: boolean
## Default: false
# 
# If this variable is set to "true", only the domains started via config 
# files in XENDOMAINS_AUTO will be treated according to XENDOMAINS_SYSRQ,
# XENDOMAINS_MIGRATE, XENDOMAINS_SAVE, XENDMAINS_SHUTDOWN; otherwise
# all running domains will be. 
# Note that the name matching is somewhat fuzzy.
# 
XENDOMAINS_AUTO_ONLY=false

## Type: integer
## Default: 300
#
# On xendomains stop, a number of xm commands (xm migrate, save, shutdown,
# shutdown --all) may be executed. In the worst case, these commands may
# stall forever, which will prevent a successful shutdown of the machine.
# If this variable is non-zero, the script will set up a watchdog timer
# for every of these xm commands and time it out after the number of seconds
# specified by this variable.
# Note that SHUTDOWN_ALL will not be called if no virtual machines or only
# zombies are still running, so you don't need to enable this timeout just
# for the zombie case.
# The setting should be large enough to make sure that migrate/save/shutdown
# can succeed. If you do live migrations, keep in mind that live migration
# of a 1GB machine over Gigabit ethernet may actually take something like
# 100s (assuming that live migration uses 10% of the network # bandwidth).
# Depending on the virtual machine, a shutdown may also require a significant
# amount of time. So better setup this variable to a huge number and hope the
# watchdog never fires.

XENDOMAINS_STOP_MAXWAIT=300
