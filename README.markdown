# Puppet Virtualization Management Module

Puppet Module to manage virtual machines. Provides a the type: `virt`.

----------------

### virt

Manage virtual environments. [Xen] [1], [KVM] [2], [OpenVZ] [3], and [LXC] [4] hypervisors are supported, which of the first three uses [libvirt] [5] as provider.
This module is the result of my work at GSoC 2010. I thank [Reliant Security] [6] for funding the OpenVZ provider development.

**Autorequires:** If Puppet is managing Xen or KVM guests, the virt resource will autorequire `libvirt` library.

Example:

    virt { server:
      ensure      => 'running',
      id          => 101,
      os_template => 'ubuntu-10.10',
      virt_type   => 'openvz',
      autoboot    => 'false'
    }

Note that some values can be specified as an array of values:

    virt { server:
      ensure      => 'installed',
      memory      => 512,
      os_template => 'ubuntu-10.10-x86_64',
      virt_type   => 'openvz',
      autoboot    => true,
      interfaces  => ["eth0", "eth1"]
    }

LXC Example:

    virt { 'lxc1':
      ensure      => running,
      os_template => 'ubuntu',
      provider    => 'lxc'
    }

    # clone from lxc1
    virt { 'lxc2':
      ensure   => running,
      clone    => 'lxc1',
      snapshot => true,
      provider => 'lxc',
      require  => Virt['lxc1']
    }

##### virt_type

Specify the guest virtualization type. Mandatory field.
Available values:

* `xen_fullyvirt`: Request the use of full virtualization, if both para & full virtualization are available on the host. This parameter may not be available if connecting to a Xen hypervisor on a machine without hardware virtualization support. This parameter is implied if connecting to a QEMU based hypervisor.
* `xen_paravirt`: This guest should be a paravirtualized guest. It requires hardware virtualization support
* `kvm`: When installing a QEMU guest, make use of the KVM or KQEMU kernel acceleration capabilities if available. Use of this option is recommended unless a guest OS is known to be incompatible with the accelerators.
* `openvz`: When defining an OpenVZ guest, the `os_template` paramenter must be defined.
* `lxc`: When defining an lxc guest, the `os_template` paramenter must be defined.

The values `xen_fullyvirt`, `xen_paravirt` and `kvm` will use libvirt as provider. `openvz` will use the `openvz` provider.

##### xml_file

This is the path to a predefined xml config file, to be used with the import function.

##### ve_root

Sets the path to the mount point for the container root directory (default `VE_ROOT` is specified at `vz.conf` file). Argument can contain literal string `$VEID`, which will be substituted with the numeric CT ID.

Requires features `storage_path`.

##### ve_private

Set the path to directory in which all the files and directories specific to this very container are stored (default `VE_PRIVATE` is specified at `vz.conf` file). Argument can contain literal string `$VEID`, which will be substituted with the numeric CT ID.

Requires features `storage_path`.

##### configfile

OpenVZ:

If specified, values from example configuration file `/etc/vz/conf/ve-<VALUE>.conf-sample` are put into the container configuration file. If this container configuration file already exists, it will be removed.

LXC:

Specify the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation functionalities for the container

Requires features `initial_config`.

##### user

User name and password. It is generally a good idea to keep to the degenerate 8 characters, beginning with a letter.

Sets password for the given user in the guest, creating the user if it does not exists. In case guest is not running, it is automatically mounted, then all the appropriate file changes are applied, then it is unmounted.

Requires features `manages_users`.

For OpenVZ guests, must use the format: "user:password"

##### ipaddr

IP address(es) of the guest. Multiple IP addresses should be specified as an array.

##### interfaces

Connect the guest network to the host using the specified network as a bridge. The value can take one of 2 formats:

* `disabled`: The guest will have no network.
* `[ "ethX", ... ] | "ethX"`: The guest can receive one or an array with interface's name from host to connect to the guest interfaces.
* `ifname[,mac,host_ifname,host_mac,[bridge]]`: For OpenVZ hypervisor, the network interface must be specified using the format above, where:
 * 'ifname' is the ethernet device name in the guest;
 * 'mac' is its MAC address;
 * 'host_ifname' is the ethernet device name on the host;
 * 'host_mac' is its MAC address. MAC addresses should be in the format like `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`.

Bridge is an optional parameter which can be used in custom network start scripts to automatically add the interface to a bridge. All parameters except ifname are optional and are automatically generated if not specified.

If the specified interfaces does not exist, it will be ignored and raises a warning.

##### macaddrs

Fixed MAC address for the guest;
If this parameter is omitted, or the value \"RANDOM\" is specified a suitable address will be randomly generated.

For Xen virtual machines it is required that the first 3 pairs in the MAC address be the sequence '00:16:3e', while for QEMU or KVM virtual machines it must be '54:52:00'.
For OpenVZ virtual machine, the interface must exists previously.

##### network_cards

Moves network device from the host system to a specified OpenVZ guest. Multiple network cards should be specified as an array.
Requires features `manages_devices`.

##### nameserver

DNS name server(s). Multiple name servers should be specified as an array.

##### searchdomain

DNS search domain name(s).

##### iptables

Requires features iptables.

##### arch

The domain's installation architecture. Not Changeable.
If not specified for OpenVZ guests, it will assume the same archtecture from host machine.

##### memory

The maximum amount of memory allocation for the guest domain.

##### cpus

Number of virtual CPUs active in the guest domain.

##### cpuunits

CPU weight for a guest. Argument is positive non-zero number, passed to and used in the kernel fair scheduler.
The larger the number is, the more CPU time this guest gets. Maximum value is 500000, minimal is 8. Number is relative to weights of all the other running guests. If cpuunits are not specified, default value of 1000 is used.
Requires features `cpu_fair`.

##### cpulimit

Limit of CPU usage for the guest, in per cent. Note if the computer has 2 CPUs, it has total of 200% CPU time. Default CPU limit is 0 (no CPU limit).
Requires features `cpu_fair`.

##### ioprio

Assigns I/O priority to guest. Priority range is 0-7. The greater priority is, the more time for I/O activity guest has. By default each guest has priority of 4.
Requires features `cpu_fair`.

##### graphics

Setup a virtual console in the guest to be imported. If no graphics option is specified, will default to enable.
Available values:

* `enable`: Setup a virtual console in the guest and export it as a VNC server in the host. The VNC server will run on the first free port number at 5900 or above.
* `vnc:VNCPORT`: Request a permanent, statically assigned port number for the guest VNC console. Use of this option is discouraged as other guests may automatically choose to run on this port causing a clash.
* `disable`: No graphical console will be allocated for the guest.
Requires features `graphics`.

##### clocksync

The guest clock synchronization can assume three possible values, allowing fine grained control over how the guest clock is synchronized to the host. NB, not all hypervisors support all modes.
Available values:

* `utc`: The guest clock will always be synchronized to UTC when booted
* `localtime`: The guest clock will be synchronized to the host's configured timezone when booted, if any.
* `timezone`: The guest clock will be synchronized to the requested timezone using the timezone attribute.
* `variable`: The guest clock will have an arbitrary offset applied relative to UTC. The delta relative to UTC is specified in seconds, using the adjustment attribute. The guest is free to adjust the RTC over time an expect that it will be honoured at next reboot. This is in contrast to 'utc' mode, where the RTC adjustments are lost at each reboot.
NB, at time of writing, only QEMU supports the variable clock mode, or custom timezones.

Requires features `clocksync`.

##### tmpl_repo

The URL from where download OpenVZ precreated templates. Default value: `http://download.openvz.org/template/precreated/`

##### boot_location

##### quotaugidlimit

Sets maximum number of user/group IDs in a guest for which disk quota inside the guest will be accounted. If this value is set to 0, user and group quotas inside the guest will not be accounted.

Note that if you have previously set value of this parameter to 0, changing it while the guest is running will not take effect.
Requires features `disk_quota`.

##### diskinodes

Sets soft and hard disk quotas, in i-nodes. Must follow the format: `N:N` where first parameter is soft quota, second is hard quota.
Requires features `disk_quota`.

##### on_crash

The content of this element specifies the action to take when the guest crashes. Available values:

* `destroy`: The domain will be terminated completely and all resources released.
* `restart`: The domain will be terminated, and then restarted with the same configuration.
* `preserve`: The domain will be terminated, and its resource preserved to allow analysis.
* `rename-restart`: The domain will be terminated, and then restarted with a new name."

Requires features `manages_capabilities`.
WARNING: setting some of those capabilities may have far reaching security implications, so do not do it unless you know what you are doing. Also note that setting `setpcap` to `on` for a guest will most probably lead to inability to start it.

##### resources_parameters

Requires one or two arguments. In case of one argument, vzctl sets barrier and limit to the same value. In case of two colon-separated arguments, the first is a barrier, and the second is a limit. Each argument is either a number, a number with a suffix, or the special value `unlimited`. UBC parameters description can be found at: `http://wiki.openvz.org/UBC_parameters_table`.

----------------


## Future Work

For now, some parameters will have a few values acceptable:

  * Add to Facter facts about host's OpenVZ information;
  * Implement VServer provider;
  * `virt_path` will accept only existing .img, .qcow and .qcow2 files;
  * Input devices specification like mouse will not be supported for now;
  * The parameters `on_poweroff`, `on_reboot` and `on_crash` for libvirt provider are not changeable. They will be used only to create a new domain using Libvirt provider (not for import existing domain's image, because libvirt does not support modify those values).
